# Wall-Of-Shame
Making fun of people who need to be humbled. Mostly from Counter Strike. I'll also include some amazing people, it's just more fun to poke the ones who deserve it.

## Internet Gangsters Who Tried to Dox Me, But Only Found My Github
Was playing a Counter Strike match, and these guys weren't very happy they were losing. We died laughing in our VC that they had to resort to this.

## "1.86, remember that, my K/D"
Played Counter Strike on a day I knew I wasn't going to do great cause of depression. This dude had macros for rage bait phrases, and thought he was doing something by using them on me. I was already depressed that day, so he just made me laugh cause of how dumb it is.
