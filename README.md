# Wall-Of-Shame
Making fun of people who need to be humbled. Mostly from Counter Strike. I'll also include some amazing people, it's just more fun to poke the ones who deserve it.
If you're seeing this, don't put yourself on this list. Be the good in the world. It's worth it

Was playing a Counter Strike match, and these guys weren't very happy they were losing. We died laughing in our VC that they had to resort to this.

Played Counter Strike on a day I knew I wasn't going to do great cause of depression. This dude had macros for rage bait phrases, and thought he was doing something by using them on me. I was already depressed that day, so he just made me laugh cause of how dumb it is.

Not the best game of Counter Strike. My team wanted to immedietly forfeit because it was Overpass, a map no one likes. One of them just quit, then half tried to vote to surrender. The other team started talking back about winning a 5v4, and 2 of them were pretty miserable. Sadly I think it was an older / younger brother duo, and that sucks. I will admit I was kind of toxic back, but I tried to not talk back too much. To end the game, we lost, I told my team good job, have a good day, and promptly got told to shut up.
